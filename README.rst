SciPy 2014 Astropy Workshop
===========================

The purpose of this workshop is to give you an overview of functionality in
Astropy, and get you started with some simple problems. There is a *lot* of
functionality that we cannot cover in this workshop, so we encourage you to
browse the Astropy `Documentation <http://docs.astropy.org>`_ to get a sense
of what it can be used for!

Notebooks
---------

The ``notebooks/`` directory contains the following IPython notebooks which
contain the workshop material.  Apart from the introduction, each topic has an
accompanying ``solutions`` notebook with solutions for the exercises.

* Introduction: ``01_Introduction.ipynb``
* Units and Quantities: ``02_Unit_Conversion.ipynb``
* Tables: ``03_Tables.ipynb``
* Handling FITS Files: ``04_Handling_FITS_Files.ipynb``
* Handling ASCII Data Tables: ``05_Handling_ASCII_data_tables.html``
* Celestial Coordinates ``06_Celestial_Coordinates.ipynb``

To run the notebooks in from the git repository using IPython notebook, do::

  % cd notebooks
  % ipython notebook

This should fire up an index page in your default web browser.
